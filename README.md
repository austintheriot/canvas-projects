## About

This repository is a collection of previous JavaScript projects I've worked on
that involve interactive, generative visuals or art in some way. Each project
provides setting controls for visitors to play around with and generate new
patterns. The final result can be seen live
[here](https://canvasprojects.imfast.io/index.html).

## Tech

Built primarily with the JavaScript Canvas API and a small amount of HTML and
CSS to provide the settings interface.

## Projects

### Web Particles

Physics-based particle playground. I originally intended for this project to serve as a lightweight background animation for a landing page. Since I've added more features and interactivity to it, however, it functions better a small particle/physics simulation app.

### Brownian Motion

Procedurally generated (yet aesthetic) scrbbles. Inspired by the [natural phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) by the same name.

### Fractures

This project draws inspiration from the way glass panes and ceramic dishes crack. Each line is given a random chance to break away as it travels in one direction and stops when it reaches another line.

### Stochastic Roots

Uses a fractal-inspired branching technique. Creates branching networks resembling roots or trees (depending on the direction).
